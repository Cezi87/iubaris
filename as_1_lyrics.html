                                        <h3>Antigod</h3>
                                        (music/lyrics: Antares)<br /><br />
                                            <p>Everyday you regret that you live on<br />
											   Every end of each path is a dead end<br />
											   There is no past, and the future is dead<br />
											   Your own words without hope full off hollow<br />
<br />
											   There is no single side you could stand on<br />
											   No noble ideals you could fight for<br />
											   You are full of dirt that consumes you<br />
											   Trying to save yoursef, though you're long dead<br />
<br />
											   I refuse to live just to die<br />
											   I swear you will pay for your lies<br />
											   I feel the hate boil inside<br />
											   Twisting and turning me into god</p><br />
                                            <br /><h3>Rising Flame</h3>
                                        (music/lyrics: Antares)<br /><br />
                                            <p>The curtains arise<br />
											   Behold the final act<br />
											   Humanity devoured<br />
											   Devoured by consumption and fear<br />
											   <br />
											   We slaughter each other<br />
											   While the heavens seem to be falling<br />
											   Rushing in our direction<br />
											   Whole our lives drowning and drifting away<br />
											   <br />
											   There is an answer to every question<br />
											   Reach out for chaos<br />
											   The power of one<br />
											   Help me destroy all blindness and doubts<br />
											   Reach out for chaos<br />
											   The power of one<br />
											   I erase all mistakes done through the eons<br />
											   Reach out for chaos<br />
											   The power of one<br />
											   The only true purpose to create and conquer<br />
											   Reach out for chaos<br />
											   The power of one<br />
											   <br />
											   Why are you still <br />
											   Doubting yourself?<br />
											   Why are you still <br />
											   Existing as someone else?<br />
											   Living lies<br />
											   As the gift of life<br />
											   Left you terrified<br />
											   Your path leads to demise<br />
											   <br />
											   There is an answer to every question<br />
											   Reach out for chaos<br />
											   The power of one<br />
											   Help me destroy all blindness and doubts<br />
											   Reach out for chaos<br />
											   The power of one<br />
											   I erase all mistakes done through the eons<br />
											   Reach out for chaos<br />
											   The power of one<br />
											   The only true purpose to create and conquer<br />
											   Reach out for chaos<br />
											   The power of one<br />
											   <br />
											   I can claim it all back<br />
											   I will destroy death to find my way<br />
											   I believe in the light<br />
											   I believe in insane perfection<br />
											   I will fight all my life<br />
											   Until every man<br />
											   Will know that he is free</p><br />
                                            <br /><h3>The Journey</h3>
                                        (music/lyrics: Antares)<br /><br />
                                            <p>An imperfect world<br />
											   Slaves of blind gods<br />
											   Live your life in death<br />
											   <br />
											   But i have come<br />
											   From the other side<br />
											   Bring a new hope<br />
											   <br />
											   One voice<br />
											   From my inner self<br />
											   One voice<br />
											   That will last<br />
											   <br />
											   One voice<br />
											   I follow to death<br />
											   One voice<br />
											   That wil last<br />
											   On<br />
											   <br />
											   Secrets of dark light<br />
											   I bring a gift<br />
											   That will show the way<br />
											   May this fire burn<br />
											   May it spread all around<br />
											   May it consume all<br />
											   <br />
											   A journey so long<br />
											   To the other side<br />
											   The whispers of shadows<br />
											   Forever in me<br />
											   To show me the way</p><br />
               								   <br /><h3>Rebirth</h3>
                                        (music/lyrics: Antares)<br /><br />
                                            <p>Here comes the early spring<br />
											   All my poems, works and plays<br />
											   Are burie din a grave<br />
											   To rot forever there<br />
											   In a cycle of death and pain<br />
											   The spirit lost without a trace<br />
											   Did I finally give too much<br />
											   Have I finally crossed the line?<br />
<br />
											   Now I am crawling back again<br />
											   To the swamps and the black lake<br />
											   To finish my last work<br />
											   To rejoin with those parts<br />
                                               I did give to The Abyss<br />
                                               Death is such a beautiful thing<br />
                                               When it bears your name</p>
